        "desc": "The <i>Exploring Data Worlds at the Public Library</i> research project is supported by a grant from the Institute for Museum and Library Services. The project explores youth data literacy in the context of youth services in maker spaces at the public library. The goals of the <i>Exploring Data Worlds</i> project are threefold: 1) to generate social science observations about young peoples’ interactions with data, including their self-awareness as data subjects, 2) to discover the unique data literacy needs of digital youth in terms of their critical and civic participation in a data driven society, and 3) develop strategies for training youth librarians in order to provide them with the skills to empower young people. See recent publications for details about this project, Chi, Y., Jeng, W., Acker, A., & Bowler, L., 2018; Acker, A. & Bowler, L., 2018; Bowler, L., Acker, A., Jeng, W. & Chi, Y., 2017; Acker, A. & Bowler, L., 2017.

        "desc": "This project looked at mean and cruel online behavior through the lens of design, with the goal of developing positive technologies for youth. Visual narrative inquiry – a storytelling method – was used in the early stages of this project to explore the relationship between reflection (the metacognitive piece), values, and interaction design. Seven emergent design themes were evident in the participants’ design recommendations and these design themes were then associated with a values-framework (Cheng & Fleishman, 2010).

Answers</i>, with the aim of contributing to the greater understanding of youth information behavior, health information literacy, and the role of social Q&A and affect in the provision of health information to young people.
