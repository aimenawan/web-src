        My teaching is guided by a commitment to provide students with an enriched, student-centered learning
        environment. My goal is to design learning environments that are adaptive to the personal interests and
        individual life situations of students while still maintaining a clear sight on a set of learning objectives
        and professional outcomes for the student. In recognition of my teaching success, I was presented with the 2012
        ALISE-Pratt-Severn Faculty Innovation Award, an award for innovation in teaching in Library and Information
        Science programs.
